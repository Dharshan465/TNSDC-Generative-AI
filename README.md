# Project Title:Indian Food Classification Using CNN ( Deep Learning Algorithm )

## Problem Statement
Identifying and categorizing Indian dishes from images can be challenging due to the diversity and complexity of Indian cuisine. Manual classification of food items is time-consuming and prone to errors, hindering the efficiency of tasks such as menu management, food blogging, and culinary education.

## Project Overview:

The Indian Food Classification project aims to leverage deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), to classify Indian dishes from images. This project addresses the challenge of automating the classification process, which is traditionally time-consuming and error-prone when done manually.

## Objectives:

Develop a CNN-based model capable of accurately classifying various Indian dishes from images.
Deploy the trained model in a web and mobile application for real-time predictions.
Evaluate the model's performance using standard metrics to ensure reliable classification results.

## Conclusion:

The Indian Food Classification project demonstrates the application of deep learning techniques in automating the classification of Indian dishes from images. By providing a reliable and efficient solution for identifying Indian cuisine, this project contributes to enhancing user experience in exploring, managing, and showcasing Indian dishes in various contexts. Through continuous improvement and refinement, this project aims to further advance the capabilities of automated food classification systems, catering to the diverse needs of users interested in Indian cuisine and beyond.
